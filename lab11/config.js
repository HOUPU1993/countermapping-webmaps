    para1: 'As the remnants of Hurricane Sandy dissipate over northern Canada, the full scale of the damage left in her wake is becoming apparent. At least 56 people in the U.S. were killed and another 67 in the Caribbean. Cost estimates have ranged as high as $60 billion so far. More than 4 million people remain without power, as crews from across the country converge on the Northeast to restore electricity. Hard-hit sections of New York and New Jersey have begun cleanup, with some restoration of transit and services. The morning commute into Manhattan today was chaotic, as many New Yorkers attempted to return to work by car -- many were turned back due to an order that inbound cars carry at least three people. Collected here are images of Sandy trail of destruction in New York and New Jersey.',

            description: 'New York was severely affected by Hurricane Sandy on October 29â€“30, 2012, particularly New York City, its suburbs, and Long Island. Sandy impacts included the flooding of the New York City Subway system, of many suburban communities, and of all road tunnels entering Manhattan except the Lincoln Tunnel. The New York Stock Exchange closed for two consecutive days. Numerous homes and businesses were destroyed by fire, including over 100 homes in Breezy Point, Queens. Large parts of the city and surrounding areas lost electricity for several days. Several thousand people in midtown Manhattan were evacuated for six days due to a crane collapse at Extell One57. Bellevue Hospital Center and a few other large hospitals were closed and evacuated. Flooding at 140 West Street and another exchange disrupted voice and data communication in lower Manhattan.',

            description: 'The city classifies Red Hook Houses as being in flood zone 1, indicating high flood risk. Before Hurricane Sandy in 2012, various city reports had outlined the need for increased flood protection, projecting floods as high as 5 feet during storm surges. NYCHA officials responded that they did not anticipate storm surges that strong.When Hurricane Sandy struck, the development was inundated with 6 feet (1.8 m) of flood water through sewer overflow and high tides. The storm left residents without power and fresh water for months. This caused leaks, resulting in mold that hurt many residents health.',
